					INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
				</h3>

				<p class="fs-5 lh-sm">
					We permit our trusted business partners and third-party advertising companies (including ad servers, ad

					numerical identifiers associated with your browser or device in order to provide ads on our behalf that

				</p>

				<p class="fs-5 lh-sm">
					Using tracking technologies, discussed in more detail under “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies”
					below, these companies collect data from a particular browser or device about a user’s web viewing
					behaviors over time, across unrelated websites, and in some cases combine such data with data collected
					from other browsers or devices associated with the same user or household, and use such data to predict
					user preferences and to deliver advertisements to that user which are calculated to target that user’s
					predicted preferences across devices.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-5 lh-sm">
					Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of the third-party advertising
					companies that utilize cookies on our website to provide interest-based advertising enable you to opt out
					of those practices. If you would like to learn more about interest-based advertising and see what choices
					you may have about how companies use your information, please go to aboutads.info or
					networkadvertising.org. We do not operate or control these sites, and are not responsible for the opt-out
					choices available there. It is important to note that in most cases opting out drops an “opt-out cookie”
					on your browser. As a result, if you delete cookies or use a different computer or browser, you’ll need
					to renew your opt-out choice.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-5 lh-sm">
					Another way to opt-out of or control the collection of data for interest-based advertising is to adjust
					your browser settings as further described in the “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section
					below.
				</p>

				<p class="fs-5 lh-sm">
					Please remember, even if you opt out of interest-based advertising on or through these sites and other
					opt-out sites or services, or by adjusting your browser settings, you may still receive ads from X-Under
					LLC., as interest-based ads are only one form of advertising.
